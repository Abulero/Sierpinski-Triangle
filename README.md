# SierpinskiTriangle
Here's a cool thought exercise:

Let's think of a triangle and let's name its vertices V1, V2 and V3.

Pick a random vertex, say, V2 and put a dot on it.

Now here's the exercise: we are going to randomize another vertex, say, V3, and we're going to put another dot halfway between dot 1 and V3.
